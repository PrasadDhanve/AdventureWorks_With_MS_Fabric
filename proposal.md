# Project Proposal: Microsoft Fabric Interface and Capabilities

## Project Overview
The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of Microsoft Fabric through a structured approach, showcasing end-to-end solutions within a single environment. The key focus areas include workspace creation, lakehouse setup, data wrangling, modeling, SQL querying for insights, and Power BI integration.

## Objectives
1. To create a workspace within the Microsoft Fabric environment.
2. To establish a lakehouse under the workspace for structured data storage.
3. To perform data operations including data wrangling and conversion into a star schema.
4. To utilize the data wrangler tool for basic data operations and efficiency.
5. To convert data into fact and dimension tables using PySpark.
6. To create a model inside the lakehouse with established relationships for data analysis.
7. To leverage SQL querying for insights and answering specific questions.
8. To create a semantic model for Power BI integration within the Fabric environment.
9. To validate data models and ensure proper data visualization using Power BI.

## Methodology
1. **Workspace Creation**: Utilize the Microsoft Fabric interface to create a dedicated workspace.
2. **Lakehouse Setup**: Establish a lakehouse infrastructure within the workspace for structured data storage.
3. **Data Preparation and Wrangling**: Import a dataset from Kaggle and perform data wrangling to convert it into a star schema.
4. **Data Wrangler Tool**: Utilize the data wrangler tool available in the Fabric environment for efficient data operations.
5. **Data Conversion and Modeling**: Convert data into fact and dimension tables using PySpark and establish necessary relationships for modeling.
6. **SQL Querying and Analysis**: Use SQL endpoints to gather insights and answer specific questions regarding the data.
7. **Power BI Integration**: Create a semantic model for Power BI integration to visualize data within the Fabric environment.
8. **Data Validation and Visualization**: Validate data models and ensure proper visualization using Power BI graphs and charts.

## Deliverables
1. Workspace created within Microsoft Fabric.
2. Lakehouse infrastructure established under the workspace.
3. Dataset imported, cleaned, and converted into a star schema.
4. Data models created, including fact and dimension tables.
5. SQL queries developed for data analysis and insights.
6. Semantic model created for Power BI integration.
7. Data validation results and visualizations using Power BI.

## Conclusion
The project aims to demonstrate the comprehensive capabilities of Microsoft Fabric in handling end-to-end data solutions efficiently. By following a structured approach and leveraging the Fabric environment's tools and functionalities, we aim to deliver a robust data analytics and visualization solution.
