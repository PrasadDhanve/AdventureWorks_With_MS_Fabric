# Project Title: Microsoft Fabric Interface and Capabilities

## Overview
This project showcases the capabilities of Microsoft Fabric, demonstrating end-to-end solutions within a single environment. It covers workspace creation, lakehouse setup, data wrangling, modeling, SQL querying for insights, and Power BI integration.

## Project Steps
1. **Workspace Creation**
   - Created a workspace within the Microsoft Fabric environment.

2. **Lakehouse Setup**
   - Established a lakehouse under the workspace.

3. **Notebook Creation**
   - Added a new notebook under the lakehouse for data operations.

4. **Data Preparation**
   - Installed necessary libraries and imported a dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle library.
   - Performed data wrangling to convert the dataset into a star schema.

5. **Data Wrangler Tool**
   - Utilized the data wrangler tool available in the Fabric environment for basic data operations.

6. **Data Conversion and Modeling**
   - Converted the dataset into fact and dimension tables.
   - Assigned different dataframes for structured storage.
   - Used PySpark to convert dataframes into lakehouse tables.

7. **Model Creation**
   - Created a model inside the lakehouse, establishing necessary relationships.

8. **SQL Querying**
   - Leveraged SQL endpoints to gather insights from the data by answering specific questions using SQL queries.

9. **Semantic Model for Power BI**
   - Created a semantic model to load data into Power BI within the Fabric environment.

10. **Data Validation**
    - Plotted a graph to ensure proper data modeling inside the semantic model.
